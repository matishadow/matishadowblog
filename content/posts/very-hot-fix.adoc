= Very Hot Fix üå∂Ô∏è

== Emergency call
Let's imagine yourself sleeping on Saturday night.
You feel cozy, calm and dreamy in your REM phase.
Suddenly you hear your phone ringing.
In the first moment you think it's ringing in your dream, but
then you wake up and drunkenly look at the phone.
You register two things in your brain, 2 A.M. and your boss' name as a caller.
For a split second you question your life choices but for some reason you decide to answer.
On the other end your boss tells you that the production crushes and begs you to fix it.
He asserts you he'll pay tenfold for this overtime (ten times zero is still zero, heh).
Will you offer your expertise this time?

== How hot is very hot?

The company you work for is pretty big.
Every minute the production does not respond the company loses thousands of monies.
You have to fix the production quickly because every minute counts.

You cannot go the usual way.
Redeploying the project would take at least 30 minutes, not even thinking about code review.
What to do then?
Well, we could do a very hot fix on the production!
