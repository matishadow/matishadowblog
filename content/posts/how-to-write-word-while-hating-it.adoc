= How To Write Word While Hating It

== Why do I hate it?
Let's explain it using a meme.

Cast the first stone if you haven't experience this situation (well maybe without the sirens).
This happens when it comes to any WYSIWYG footnote:[WYSIWYG (pronounced /ˈwɪziwɪg/ or /ˈwɪzɪwɪg/), is an acronym for What You See Is What You Get, used in computing to describe a system where things you edit on the on-screen editor appear almost the same to the final output, which might be a printed document, a web page, a PowerPoint presentation or even the lighting for a concert. Web designers often use this word to talk about their work.],
not only `Microsoft Word` and I hate them all.
How could you focus on the content you write when you have to think about formatting all the time?
I know you could setup the formatting beforehand but then you can still break it
when moving an image by a mm.

Unfortunately life is life and sometimes you have to write something in Word.
(Thank God I could use LaTeX when writing my thesis!)
One of such times could occur when you developed a new feature
and you have to describe it in some technical documentation document.
It already contains 80 pages of lousy text, and you have to add your pretty paragraph to it.
What to do then?

== Alternatives
I won't go too deep into what alternatives do we have.
In this post I assume you have your favourite tool for writing, maybe LaTeX, maybe Markdown,
maybe something more exotic.

Whatever you have the general gist is to export it to `HTML` and then import it in Word.

=== Markdown example
Let's start with something simple.
Everyone knows Markdown, right? footnote:[If you lived in a cave for the past 10 years then go ahead and learn it now: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet]

I've created a simple Markdown document to test how it looks in Word after importing it.

[source,markdown]

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
     * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
     1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

To convert it to `HTML` you can use whatever tool you have.
Probably your text editor already has plugins for doing it.
You can also use `pandoc` for doing it `pandoc markdown-test.md -o markdown-test.html`
or find some `npm` library for it `npm install markdown-to-html -g; markdown markdown-test.md  > markdown-test.html`.

I present the rendered example below.

I will use an example document, which I found on Google.

To insert your rendered file place your cursor in the place where you want to add your part.

First you go into `Insert` tab.

Then click `Object` and `Text from File...` and choose your `HTML` file.

My example looks something like this.

The result does not look ideal, for example Strikethrough did not work
but apart from this it looks pretty decent.

=== Asciidoctor

Just for comparison let's do the same with a format more advanced than Markdown.

=== H3

* [*] checked
* [x] also checked
* [ ] not checked
* normal list item

What is the answer?::
This is the answer.

Have you seen my duck?:: No.

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2

Generated `HTML` looks like this.

And after importing it to Word.

It also looks pretty decent, even the footnote worked!
