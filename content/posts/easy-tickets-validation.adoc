= Easy ticket validation 
:imagesdir: /matishadowblog/easy-ticket-validation

== Intro

Continuing the 
https://matishadow.github.io/matishadowblog/posts/hacking-buttons/[series] 
of stupid things in the real world, today we'll take a look 
at transportation in Warsaw.
And how ticket validation works for this service.

In short - it sucks.
After you buy a ticket on your phone, 
you have to scan a QR code **within 20 seconds**.
If you fail to find the QR code on the station,
the app crashes, or your phone lags, tough luck 
- **you're blocked for 3 minutes**.
Maybe you can buy another ticket and try again?
Nope, you're blocked for 3 minutes for all your tickets.

Why it works like this?
I don't even want to think about it.
It's probably some legacy security measurement
to help ticket inspectors, I don't care.

What I care about is how I can improve the experience 
for myself.

== Recon 

Let's start with scanning one of the QR codes,
and see what's the data behind it.

After scanning it we can find the following text:

----
WTPWarszawa_M19103

What do you do when you find a random piece of data?
You google it.

After checking the results,
I've found this PDF from the Warsaw Transport company:

It contains all the code for all the stations.

So jackpot I guess.
Now we can generate the QR codes for all the stations,
and have them at hand to validate.

== Second device?

But even if we generate all the QR codes,
we need some way to display them.

I could print them out, but that's too much hassle.

So let's think of another device I could have at hand with me.

Maybe my Kindle would do, but it's not really pocket size,
and I'd prefer not to switch between QR codes and books.

Then I thought about my Flipper Zero (tamagochi for hackers),
which I've bought recently.

== QR codes on Flipper Zero 

After another quick search in Google,
I've found this library for generating 
the QR codes on the Flipper.

https://github.com/bmatcuk/flipperzero-qrcode

It requires QR code data to be provided in the form
of a file with `.qrcode` extension.

.example.qrcode

----
Filetype: QRCode
Version: 0
Message: your content here

Cool, so let's write a quick Python script
to generate these files.

              'M19102': 'Natolin',
              'M19103': '0 Imielin',  # prepend 0 to make it appear at the top

# example qr code:
# WTPWarszawa_M19123


file_first_line = 'Filetype: QRCode\n'
file_second_line = 'Version: 0\n'
file_message_prefix = 'Message: WTPWarszawa_'

for code, name in code_names.items():
    f = open('qrcodes/' + name + '.qrcode', "w")

    f.write(file_first_line)
    f.write(file_second_line)
    f.write(file_message_prefix + code)

    f.close()

Now, let's transfer them to the device.

And run it on the Flipper.
