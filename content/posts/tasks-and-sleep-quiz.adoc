= .NET Tasks and Sleep Quiz
:imagesdir: /matishadowblog/easy-ticket-validation

== Intro

Some time ago I attended a job interview (as a candidate!).
After some chit-chat and non-technical questions,
I got to the technical part.
They presented a couple of code fragments and asked 
me what the output will be.

I personally think this type of questions suck.
You don't have a computer? 
Just run the damn thing, and you'll know, 
why do you need to ask me.
But that's a rant for another time.

Anyway, I answered most of the questions,
but one got me pretty angry.
The code used `Tasks` and `Thread.Sleep` in combination.
I thought I knew these topics pretty well, until that day.

After the interview, I decided to research this topic 
a bit more, and I'll tell you what I found out!

== The code

Firstly, we have this small `Number` class,
which just stores an `int` value.

Then we have this `AsyncTask` class with `DoTheMath` method.
It also has `DoubleValue` method, which is marked as `async` 
and return a `Task`.
Cool, cool.

Lastly, we have this `Main`, where we just run the `DoTheMath` method.
