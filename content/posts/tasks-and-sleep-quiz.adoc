= .NET Tasks and Sleep Quiz
:imagesdir: /matishadowblog/tasks-and-sleep-quiz

== Intro

Some time ago I attended a job interview (as a candidate!).
After some chit-chat and non-technical questions,
I got to the technical part.
They presented a couple of code fragments and asked 
me what the output will be.

I personally think this type of questions suck.
You don't have a computer? 
Just run the damn thing, and you'll know, 
why do you need to ask me.
But that's a rant for another time.

Anyway, I answered most of the questions,
but one got me pretty angry.
The code used `Tasks` and `Thread.Sleep` in combination.
I thought I knew these topics pretty well, until that day.

After the interview, I decided to research this topic 
a bit more, and I'll tell you what I found out!

== The code

image::number.png[]

Firstly, we have this small `Number` class,
which just stores an `int` value.

Then we have this `AsyncTask` class with `DoTheMath` method.
It also has `DoubleValue` method, which is marked as `async` 
and return a `Task`.
Cool, cool.

Lastly, we have this `Main`, where we just run the `DoTheMath` method.

== The question

The interviewer asked me what number will be printed out,
after we run this program.
Running it? What do you mean?
This code is so bad, that before running it I'd definitely refactor it first.

There are a couple of things wrong in this code.

* We use `Thread.Sleep(3000)` in an `async` method.
+
This blocks the current thread, preventing it from 
doing some other useful work in the meantime.
+
If you need to execute some logic after given time,
in an `async` method you should use
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.delay?view=net-8.0[`Task.Delay`]
method, which doesn't block the thread.

* This `DoubleValue` method is not awaited.
+

+
It could result in the program finishing,
before the method completing fully.
+
Always use `await` keyword when working with `async` methods.
If you need 'Fire and Forget' mechanism, 
take a look at this `SafeFireAndForget` method from this https://www.nuget.org/packages/AsyncAwaitBestPractices/[AsynAwaitBestPractices] nuget package.


But, let's assume we cannot change this code.
What was my answer then?

[quote]
I don't know, maybe the program would print `8`.
I would have to run it to fully understand it.

So let's run it!

== Running the code

=== Attempt 1
Firstly let's run the code as it is, without debugging.

image::a1.png[]

Okay, `11` it is.
The first number, `3` got doubled, and `5` did not.
`6` + `5` is `11`. 

Makes sense I guess.

=== Attempt 2

Now, let's run it with debugger attached.

image::a2.png[]

Now it's `16`, so both numbers got doubled.

=== Attempt 3 (Bonus)

I assume this weirdness has to do something with the `Thread.Sleep`,
so let's remove it and run the code 100 times without debugger.

image::a3.png[]

Okay, now it's `8` or `11` or sometimes even `16`.

image::r4.png[]

This one seems totally random.

== My attempt at explanation

=== Async/Await talk

I won't be giving you a full deep dive 
on how async await works inside.
I'll only explain what's needed for this post.
For more information, checked this talk from NDC conference.

=== How the code really looks

Firstly, let's see how our code looks after it's 'compiled'.
We'll paste it into this website:
https://sharplab.io
and check it out.

This is all the code generated for the `DoubleValue` method.

image::decomp.png[]

I know it's a lot, but bear with me.

Reading from the top, we have a new class generated for this method,
which is a state machine.
It is used to keep track of the state of this `async` method.
The state is represented by the `num` variable.
In the first iteration of this state machine,
we schedule some work to be run on something called `ThreadPool`,
and return the task.
Thanks to this state machine, the runtime will know
where to jump back in the method, when the scheduled work is finished.
By where I mean the `else` block.

=== Attempt 1 explained

Now that we know how it looks on the inside,
we could try to reason why it works as it works.

Let's see how it works step by step.


|===
|Code|Steps

a|
image::code.png[]

a|
. We enter the `DoTheMath` method.
. We create two numbers, one with value `3`, and one with `5`.
. We enter the `DoubleValue` method.
.. We set the state of the state machine to `-` and start it.
.. In `MoveNext` we enter the `if` because `num != 0`.
.. We sleep for 3 seconds in the main thread.
.. Using `Task.Run` we schedule some work to `ThreadPool` (probably a different thread).
.. Since the work is not completed yet we return from `MoveNext`.
.. And lastly we return a `Task`.
. We enter another `DoubleValue` and do the same steps (including waiting 3 seconds).
. We print the sum of the numbers.
|===

**The important observation is that 
this second `Thread.Sleep(3000)`
guarantees that the first action of doubling completes 
before printing the sum.**
The second action is not awaited in any way,
so it doesn't have the chance to finish before printing the sum.
And that's why we see `11`.

==== Attempt 2 

Okay but why when the debugger is attached we see `16`?
Well, I'm not sure to be honest.
I can only assume that it's because the debugger makes the program slower.
When it's slowed down, the doubling action has the time to finish
on a separate thread,
before we print the number to the console.

=== Attempt 3 explained

Without the `Thread.Sleep`, 
we basically have a race condition
between first doubling, second doubling, and printing to the console.
The order of them finishing is quite random, so the result is also
quite random.

== Conclusion

Despite not liking this task as a job interview question,
I enjoyed digging deeper into async programming because of it.
And I do recommend attending job interview for this sole purpose,
even if you're not looking to change your job!
