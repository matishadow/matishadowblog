= .NET Tasks and Sleep Quiz
:imagesdir: /matishadowblog/tasks-and-sleep-quiz

== Intro

Some time ago I attended a job interview (as a candidate!).
After some chit-chat and non-technical questions,
I got to the technical part.
They presented a couple of code fragments and asked 
me what the output will be.

I personally think this type of questions suck.
You don't have a computer? 
Just run the damn thing, and you'll know, 
why do you need to ask me.
But that's a rant for another time.

Anyway, I answered most of the questions,
but one got me pretty angry.
The code used `Tasks` and `Thread.Sleep` in combination.
I thought I knew these topics pretty well, until that day.

After the interview, I decided to research this topic 
a bit more, and I'll tell you what I found out!

== The code

Firstly, we have this small `Number` class,
which just stores an `int` value.

Then we have this `AsyncTask` class with `DoTheMath` method.
It also has `DoubleValue` method, which is marked as `async` 
and return a `Task`.
Cool, cool.

Lastly, we have this `Main`, where we just run the `DoTheMath` method.

== The question

The interviewer asked me what number will be printed out,
after we run this program.
Running it? What do you mean?
This code is so bad, that before running it I'd definitely refactor it first.

There are a couple of things wrong in this code.

* We use `Thread.Sleep(3000)` in an `async` method.
+
This blocks the current thread, preventing it from 
doing some other useful work in the meantime.
+
If you need to execute some logic after given time,
in an `async` method you should use
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.delay?view=net-8.0[`Task.Delay`]
method, which doesn't block the thread.

* This `DoubleValue` method is not awaited.
+

+
It could result in the program finishing,
before the method completing fully.
+
Always use `await` keyword when working with `async` methods.
If you need 'Fire and Forget' mechanism, 
take a look at this `SafeFireAndForget` method from this https://www.nuget.org/packages/AsyncAwaitBestPractices/[AsynAwaitBestPractices] nuget package.


But, let's assume we cannot change this code.
What was my answer then?

I don't know, maybe the program would print `8`.
I would have to run it to fully understand it.

So let's run it!

== Running the code

=== Attempt 1
Firstly let's run the code as it is, without debugging.

image::a1.png[]

Okay, `11` it is.
The first number, `3` got doubled, and `5` did not.
`6` + `5` is `11`. 

Makes sense I guess.

=== Attempt 2

Now, let's run it with debugger attached.

image::a2.png[]

Now it's `16`, so both numbers got doubled.

=== Attempt 3 (Bonus)

I assume this weirdness has to do something with the `Thread.Sleep`,
so let's remove it and run the code 100 times without debugger.

image::a3.png[]

Okay, now it's `8` or `11` or sometimes even `16`.
