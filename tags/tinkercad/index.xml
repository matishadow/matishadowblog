You know this meme, right? Something similar happened to me once when I unloaded the dishwasher. With the dishwasherâ€™s door opened I also opened a cupboard next to it. I guess nobody has tested to open both things at the same time before.
Everything broke. The mechanism fell into pieces and scattered across the whole kitchen. The door fell on the floor, and some plastic parts broke off.</description></item></channel></rss>
