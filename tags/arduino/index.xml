And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous — because you will never feel famous enough. Make gifts for people — and work hard on making those gifts in the hope that those people will notice and like the gifts.
Maybe they will notice how hard you worked, and maybe they won’t — and if they don’t notice, I know it’s frustrating.</description></item><item><title>Hacking buttons</title><link>/posts/hacking-buttons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hacking-buttons/</guid><description>Idea You’d think when living far from the city centre and near the underground station, there’s plenty of parking space? Nothing could be further from the truth.
However, something is even more baffling. Most of the street at which I live is closed by a road barrier which could be opened using a remote control. There’s no point in using it though because past the barrier there’re even fewer free parking spaces.</description></item></channel></rss>
